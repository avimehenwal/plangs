## Security Concepts

#### [What is a Session?](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)>)

- HTTP session token - generated by server and sent to client
- [It is not advisable to make sessionID redable @client as then site becomes suseptable to XSS attacks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12436521/why-cant-i-get-sessionid-on-the-client-side)

  - sessionID cookie is hidden from HTTP/js world

- In django, `django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware`
- Session database `backends.base.SessionBase`
- Request session in views, `request.session` dictionary type DS

### HTTP cookie

1. Server -> Browser using [set-cookie header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie)
2. Browser(for all subsequent requests) -> Server

[do not leak the cookie at client using HTTPOnly](https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly)
