### When to use classes and Objects?

> Goal is to re-create more same looking objects from classes

If you don't have a need for the class, don't use them.

But you may find benefits of classes if you want to:

- export the type definition
- manage your dependencies with Dependency Injection
- Unit Test your code
- use multiple instances
- use polymorphism

I suspect you may not be doing any of these.
